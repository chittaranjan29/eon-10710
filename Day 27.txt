Day: 26, Date: 29/1/24

Agenda:

i)What is Input and Output?
ii)What is Stream?Types of Stream.
iii)Input and Output Stream.
iv)Stream hierarchy.
v)Classes available under InputStream and OutputStream.

Mysql:

Joins
Types of Joins: Inner, Outer, Left, Right, Cross, Self

3 * 4=12

Input : It is a process of taking inputs in the program from external sources.
Output: It is a process of returning the generated output from the inputs given to the program.

Java uses the concept of stream to make the I/O operation fast. The java.io package contains all the classes
that are required for input/output operations.   

What is a stream?
It is sequence of bytes flows in a particular direction. 
Java provides three types of Streams:

i)Standard Input Stream(System.in)
ii)Standard Output Stream(System.out)
iii)Standard Error Stream(System.err)

All these streams are attached with console.

int a=System.in.read(); //returns ASCII of the given character

System.out.print((char)i);

System.err.print("Error message");

OutputStream:

i) FileOutputStream :
Java FileOutputStream is a stream used for writing data to a file.

ii)ByteArrayOutputStream iii)FilterOutputStream iv)PipedOutputStream v)ObjectOutputStream vi)DataOutputStream 
vii)BufferedOutPutStream viii)PrintStream

BufferedOutPutStream :
It internally uses buffer to store the data. It provides more efficiency in outputing the data to the destination.

InputputStream:

ByteArrayOutputStream :It is used to write common data to multiple files. It holds a copy of the data and forwards it to multiple streams.
ByteArrayInputStream : It contains an internal buffer which is used to read byte array as stream.


i) FileInputStream ii)ByteArrayInputStream iii)FilterInputStream iv)PipedInputStream v)ObjectInputStream vi)DataInputStream 
vii)BufferedInputStream viii)PushbackInputStream


Depeneding on the type of the operation: Input, Output, Error
Dependending on the type of the file: Bytes, Character


Q:-> WAP in Java to read ten lines of inputs from the user using the console and write them to a text file.
