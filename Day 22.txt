v)Database Metadata interface

i)show databases
ii)use dbname
iii)create database
iv)detete database dbname
v)
create table test(
 id int,
 name varchar(50) 

);

v)insert into tablename(`id`,`name`) values(1,'aman');
vi)select * from tablename;
vii)select id, name from tablename where id=535;
viii)Update tablename set name='Kumar', email='test@gmail.com' where id=355;
ix)delete from tablename
x)delete from table where id=1;

DriverManager:
The DriverManager class is the component of JDBC API and also a member of the java.sql package. 
The DriverManager class acts as an interface between users and drivers. It keeps track of the drivers that are available and 
handles establishing a connection between a database and the appropriate driver.


Connection interface:
A Connection is a session between a Java application and a database. It helps to establish a connection with the database.
The Connection interface is a factory of Statement, PreparedStatement, and DatabaseMetaData, i.e.,
an object of Connection can be used to get the object of Statement and DatabaseMetaData.

Statement interface:
The Statement interface provides methods to execute queries with the database. 
The statement interface is a factory of ResultSet i.e. it provides factory method to get the object of ResultSet.


PreparedStatement interface:
The PreparedStatement interface is a subinterface of Statement. It is used to execute parameterized query.

ResultSet interface:
The object of ResultSet maintains a cursor pointing to a row of a table. Initially, cursor points to before the first row.


i)Differences between Statement and PreparedStatement. 
ii)What is the use of Driver manager? 
iii)What is a connection?
iv)What is ResultSet?


Function/Stored Procedure:

We can write business logic inside the database using stored proceduce or function. 
It will increse the performance beacuse the code is precompiled.

 

CallableStamenet interface:
It is used to call function or stored Procedure.


Q:-> Create a Book table with five fields(id, name, authorName, category, price) and add few records into the table.
     Create a Java program to perform insert and select operation.(Values should be taken dynamically from the user.)
