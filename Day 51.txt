Data Binding:
It is process by which your component stays in sync with the view. Whenever the user updates the data 
in the view, Angular updates the component and if the component gets new data, Angular updates the view.  


Single /One way data binding:
In one way data binding the data flows in one direction.
Either from component to view or from view to the the component.

i)Interpolation: Interpolation allows us to include expression as part of the string literal, which we use in
the Html. Angular evaluates the expression into string and replace the original string and updates the view.
  
ii)Property Binding: It is one way data binding from component to view. It lets you set a property of an element in the view to a
property in the component.

  [binding-target]="binding-source"

iii)Event Binding: Event binding allows us to to bind events such as keystroke, click, hover, touche etc to a method in the component.

  (target-event)="TemplateStatement"

iv)Style Binding
v)class Binding

Two way data binding:(Event Binding + Property Binding)
In two way data binding the data can flow in both the directions.
From component to view and from view to the the component.

i)ngModel
