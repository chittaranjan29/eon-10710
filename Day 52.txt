Event Payload: DOM event carries the event payload i.e. the information about the event. We can acces the event payload
using $event as an argument to the handler function.

click, dblclick, focus, blur -> 



Template reference variable:
Template reference variable in Angular is used to access all the properties of any element inside the DOM.
It is denoted using # symbol.


class binding: 
The className is a property of HTML element. Hence we can make use of property binding to assign the class name 
to any HTML element. 


style binding:

Directives:Angular directives helps us to manipulate the DOM. You can change a DOM element's appearance, behavior, or layout
using the directives.

Types:
 i)Structural Directives(ngFor, ngIF, ngSwitch, ngTemplate)
 ii)Component Directives (used to create component @Component) 
 iii)Attribute Directives(ngModel, ngClass, ngStyle)


Assignment:

Create two form fields to accept integers and bind an event to a button to display the sum of the integers provided
through the input boxes.
