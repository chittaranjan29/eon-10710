**************************
Exception Handling
**************************
Day 14: 8/1/24

Agenda:
i)Throw keyword:
  Using the throw keyword we can throw any specific type of exception from any block or method
  explicitly and can handled in catch block.

 syntax: throw new NullPointerException("Null pointer exception occurred");

ii)Throws keyword:
   It is used to declare or report the checked exceptions that might occurr in a method of a  class.

  Syntax:  void test()throws IOException,SQLException,FileNotFoundException 
           {


           }    
iii)Custom Exception


Banking app
ErrorType
388932978237 -> account details
38739737932  -> Exception occured (SQLException)

AccountIdNotFOundException
AccountIdInvalidException


Food Delevery app
localtion - zipcode

ZipCodeInvalidException
BadZipCodeException
OrderIdNotFoundException

iv)Synchronization & thread safety:


resources - reading file
resources - writing file
T1
T2

i)Thred interference
	ex: print command given by two or nore users connect to the same network 
ii)Data inconsistency problem
	ex: double goldPricePerGram;

        resource goldPricePerGram;(62 thousand)

        12 am - add the product - thread1 was calculating the price of the jewellery. 
	2 gram. jewellery price = goldPricePerGram * weight;= 1.24L 
        
	resource :goldPricePerGram;(63 thousand)
	12 am - thread2 was updating the gold price for the day.
	jewellery price = goldPricePerGram * weight;= 1.26L 

A thread can access a shared resource mutually at a time. When one thread accessing the shared resource,
the other thread should wait till the thread finish the task ans once the task is finised and released
the resource the other thread will acquire the lock on the resource and access it. This feature is called
Sysnchronization or thread safety. 

resource : to access a resource the thread must acquire the lock on the resource.  
Once the task is over the thread will release the lock so that other thread can acquire it.

i)Synchronized method(object level locking)
ii)Synchonized block(object level locking)
iii)Static Synchronization (class level locking)

v)Ways to make a method, object thread safe
