Index:
An index is a data structure that allows us to add indexes in the existing table. 
It will help us to retrieve that records faster from the table.


CREATE INDEX name on table_name(column name); 

Having: Having clause was added in Mysql because the where clause can not be used with aggregate methods.
Group by: The group by clause is used to collect data from multiple records and group the result by one or more column.

Aggregate Operation: sum(), avg(), max(), min(), count()

select sum(salary) from employee ;
select avg(salary) from employee;
select min(salary) from employee;
select max(salary) from employee;
select count(salary) from employee;


Join: It is used to retrieve data from multiple tables. Join is used with select query and perfored whenever you
need to fetch records from two or more tables.


Types: Inner, left, Right, outer, cross
