Abstraction
*********************
Date: 2/1/24

Agenda:
i)What is abstraction?
It is a machanism to hide the implementation details(Background details) of something and providing the 
functionality to the user only.

ii)Ways to achieve abstraction.
  a)Using abstract class(0-100% of abstraction)
  b)Using interface(100% of abstraction)


iii)Abstract keyword: (class, method)

iv)Abstract class: Any class that is declared with abstract keyword is called abstrct class.
An abstract class can have abstract or non-abstract method.

 a)An instance of the abstract class can not be created.
 b)Abstract class can have constructor.
 c)We can have abstract class without any abstract method.
 d)static method is allowed inside the abstract class.
 e)Abstract class can have non-abstract final method.
 f)An abstract class can be extended to another abstract class.


v)Interface.
It is the blueprint of a class. To achieve abstraction interface can be created with abstract method.
Abstract method in the interface have no body. Inteface can be implemented by class and can be extended 
to another interface.
  
 a)All the methods with no body inside interface are abstract method by default.
 b)Static methods are allowed.
 c)Default method are allowed.(since Java 8) - Making the implemetation classes backword compitable after modfying the 
 actual interface. 
 d)private method are allowed.(since Java 9)
 e)All the data members are final by default.


Interface - implemented by class
          - extended by interface 

Multiple inheritance is not possible using class(using interface possible)

interface A   interface B

  class C implements A,B


interface A   interface B
 
      interface C

  class D implements C

Q:->Why multiple inheritance is not possible using class in Java?
Q:->What is marker or tagged interface?
An interface having zero members is called as tagged or marker interface.
These interface are helpful to provide instructions to the JVM to carry out some important operations.

ex: Clonable, Serializable, Remote etc.

Q:-> What is a functional interface?
An Interface with single abstract method is called Functional Interface.
ex:Runnable, Comparable, ActionListener etc.

vi)abstract class vs interface
vii)How to achieve multiple inheritance using interface.
