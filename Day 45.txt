iv)Generics in Typescript


var:(By default function scoped)
The variable declared with var keyword inside a function is only available within the function.
If we declare outside of the function, then the variable is available everywhere i.e it has global scope.

let: The variable declared with let keyword is having block-scope by default.They are scoped to block in which
they are declared i.e. inside the if/try/catch/while/for/any code block.


This means that we can only use it in the code block where we declare them. Outside the code block they are 
invisible.
If they are outside the code block but inside a function then their scope is function scope.
If they are outside the code block or function, then they have global scope.
