Optional property:
Optional property are those properties that are not mandatory.

Interface: Interface specifies properties and method of a given object. Typescript interfaces are abstract type and they 
needs to be implemened by a class, by an object or by a function. 

Access Modifiers:

Public: Public access modifer allows the class properties and methods to be accessed freely from anywhere in the code.
Private: The private access modifers restricts the access of the properties and method within the class only.
Protected: The protected access modifers properties and methods are accessible within and any classes that inherits the class. 

Generics: Generics allows us to write a function, method, class, interface in such a way that we can pass a range of data types.
It helps us in reusing the code.
