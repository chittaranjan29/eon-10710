Polymorphoism
*****************************
Day 9: 29/12/23

Doubt clearing class: 9 am

Agenda:
i)What is polymorphism?
  poly + morphs - Greek

  many forms
ii)Types of polymorphism
 Runtime Polymorphism - Dynamic/late binding - Overriding
 Compiletime Polymorphism - static/early binding - Overloading


A class - ABC(method)  -  ob.test();
  
iii)Overloading and Overriding
In a class, if we have same name methods with different number of aruments or different types
of aruments it is called as oveloaded function. This is overloading in Java.

It is a process in Java in which a function call to the overidden method is resolved at runtime.
This type of polymorphilsm is called method overriding. 

Addition - add(long , long), add(float,float), add(int , int, int), abc(float, float, float)


ob.add(35,67);

ob.add(35.8,67.5,90.23);

P - public void test()
C - public void test()
Having a same signature methods in both parent and child class is called Overriding.

 
iv)Rules of overloading and overiding
 a) final method can not be overridden.
 b) Static method can not be overridden.
 c) Private method can not be overridden.
 d) The overriding method must have the same return type or subtype.
 


v)Problems


Inheritance:Biological term.

Class from a parent class.
Code reusabilty.

OOP : i)Multilevel ii)Hierarchical iii)Single iii)Multiple v)Hybrid
Java:Ambiguity problem.
