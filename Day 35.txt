Tree Data Structure, Maven
****************************
Day: 35,  Date: 8/02/24

Agenda:
i)What is tree? type of tree?
ii)Implement tree data structure
iii)Advantages and time complexity
iv)What is Maven? What is a build tool.
v)Working of maven.


Terminologies:
Tree:A tree is a data structure in which data elements are implemented using nodes. 
Every node contains a key.


Then top node of the tree is called root node. Every node can have left and child node.

Root Node: The root node is the top most node in the tree hierarchy.
Leaf Node: A node without child node is called leaf node.
Parent Node: If any node is the descendent of any other node then the node is said to be parent node of the
sub node.
Sibling: The nodes that have the same parent node are called siblings.
Ancestor Node: An ancestor of a node is any predecessor node on a path from the root to the node.
Descendent Node:The immediate successor of the given node is knows as Descendent node.
	
Edge: The path that connects two nodes.

Application of Trees:
i)Organize data.
ii)Tier(Dictionary)
iii)B tree and B+ tree(used in database for indexing purpose)
iv)Routing table	

Types of tree data structure:
i)General tree
ii)Binary tree
iii) Binary Search Tree
iv)AVL tree
vi) Red-Black tree.
vii)B and B+ tree
viii)splay tree


General Tree:  The general tree is one of the tree data structure.In general tree a node can have 0 or
n maximum numbers of nodes.

Binary tree:
In Binary  tree each node of the tree has utmost 2 children.  
Binary Search Tree: It is a non linear data structure in which one node is connected to n number of nodes.
. 
AVL tree: It is one of the types of binary tree(a varient of Binary search tree).
It is a self balancing binary tree that was invented by Adelson, Velsky and Lindas.
It is a self balancing tree. The  self balancing is occured using balancing factor.

Red-Black tree: The red-black tree is a self balancing tree. In the AVL tree, we do not know how many rotation would be
required to balance the tree, but in red-black tree exactly two rotation is required to balance the tree.

Splay Tree: It is also a kind of Binary Search Tree in which the last acessed element is placed at the root position 
of the tree after doing some rotation.


B-tree: It is a balanced m-way tree where m defines the order of the tree.A b-tree can contain more than one key
and than two children.It always maintains the sorted  data.In b-tree the leaf nodes must be at the same level.

Traversing: Going throgh all the the nodes of a tree.
i)InOrder:
  ->Left Subtree recursively
  ->Root Node
  ->Right Subtree recursively
   
ii)PreOrder
  ->Root Node 
  ->Left Subtree recursively
  ->Right Subtree recursively

iii)PostOrder
   ->Left Subtree recursively
   ->Right Subtree recursively
   ->Root Node
