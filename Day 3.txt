Java Data Types, operators, variables
****************************************
Day -3

Data Types - 
i)Primitive - int, float, double, char etc  
ii)Non-primitive - class, function, array 
Operators
Variables

Type Casting:
Converting a value of one data type to another is called type casting.
i) Implicit: Data value is converted by the compiler. 
ii)Explicit: Programmer or developer can convert the data type form one to another. 

float a=12.78f;
int b=a; //12

float a=12.78;
int b=(int)a; //12


Class Student - ob1, ob2

AutoBoxing: Converting a primitive data type into its equivalent object type is called Autoboxing.
Unboxing:Converting an object into its equivalent primitive type is called Unboxing.

Long, Boolean, Float, Double - Wrapper classes 


Operators:Operators are symbols in Java used to perform specific operation.

Operands

a+b   
+   - operator 
a,b - operands


Operators:

Type of operation Wise:
i)Arithmatic ii)Relational iii)Logical iv)Bitwise v)Shift vi)Assignment

a+b, a-b, a*b, a/b, a%b
a>b, a<b, a>=b, b<=c
&&, ||, !
xor,
>>,<<

Number of operands wise:
i)Unary - require only 1 operand (a++,--a,++b,b--)
ii)Binary-require atleast two operands (a+b, a*b)
iii)Ternary/Conditional-require atleast three operands

boolean status=(a>b)?true:false;

Array: It is a group of similar data values stored in contiguous memory location.
i)It supports random access of the elements.
ii)The element positions are denoted using  numbers called indices. Indices starts from 0 and goes up to length -1.
iii)Array has fixed size.The array size can not be changed.
iv)Array does not support mixed data types.
v)It the bound of array index is crossed then compiler will throw Runtime error(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException).


[12,67,55,78] - Integer Array
[23.8, 89.5, 78., 9.3] - Float array
['g','*','T','I'] - Character Array
