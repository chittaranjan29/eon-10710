Synchronization
*********************************
Date: 9/1/24 (Day 15)


Agenda:
i)Block level synchronization:
Synchronized block can be used to perform synchronization on any specific resource of the method.

  a)Synchronizaed block is used to lock an object of any shared resource.
  b)The scope of the synchronized block is smaller than method. 
  c)The system performance may degrade because of slower working of synchronized keyword.
  d)Synchronized block is more efficient than synchronized method.	
	
ii)Static Synchronization

iii)Atomic variable:
Using atomic variable is another way to achieve thread safety in Java. When variables are shared by multiple threads,
that automic variable ensures that thread don't crash into each other.

 
iv)Volatile keyword:
A volatile keyword is a field modifier that ensures that the object can be used by multiple threads at the same time
without having any problem. Volatile is one good way of ensuring that that java program is thread safe.
