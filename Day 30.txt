Agenda:
i)Insertion Sort, advantages, disadvantages and time complexity
ii)Merge Sort,advantages, disadvantages and time complexity
iii)Quick Sort,advantages, disadvantages and time complexity

Recap:
i)Searching & Sorting
ii)Linear and binary search
iii)selection and bubble sorting


Insertion Sort:
In insertion sort, the array is virtually split into a sorted and unsorted part. Values from the unsorted array are 
picked up and placed at the cotrrect position at the sorted part.

Advantages:
i)This algorithm is very simple and easy to implement.


Disadvantages:
i)It is applicable for small data values.
ii)It is appropriate for datasets the are partially sorted.

Time complexity:
i)Best: O(N)
ii)Average: O(N^2)
iii)Worst : O(N^2)


Merge Sort:It is defined as a sorting algorithm that works by dividing ar array by into smaller subarrays,
sorting each subarray, and then merging the sorted subarrays back together to form the sorted final array.

Advantages:
i)It is a stable sorting algorithm, which means it maintains the relative order of equal elements in the input array.
ii)Merge sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(NlogN) which means that it performs well even on larger data sets.
iii)Merge sort is a naturally parallelizable algorithm, whcih means it can be easily parallelized to take advantage of 	  	 
multiple processor or thread.

Disadvantages:
i)Merge sort requires additional memory to store the managed sub arrays during the sorting process.
ii)For small data sets it has higher time complexity which means slower performance for very small datasets. 

Time Complexity:
Best: O(N)
Average: O(NlogN)
wrost: O(NlogN)
