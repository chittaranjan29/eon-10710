Agenda:
i)What is test life cycle?
ii)@BeforeEach, @AfterEach, @AfterAll, @BeforeAll
iii)Parameterized test
iv)Assert methods 


Recap:
i)TDD 
ii)BDD
iii)Junit test cases - @Test

assertTrue
assertFalse
assertSame
assertEquals
assertNull
assertNotNull
assertSame
assertTimeout - @timeOut
@Repested, @Disabled

Life Cycle:
/*
 * Set up: This phase put the test infrastructure in place.Junit provides class level setup
 * and method level setup.
 * 
 * Test execution:In this phase test execution and assertion happens.
 * The execution result will signify a success or failure.
 * 
 * 
 * Clean up: This phase is used to clean up the test infrastructure setup in the first 
 * phase.Just like setup,teardown also happens at class level and method level.  
 * 
 * 
 */

Interview Questions:
i)What is test life cycle?
ii)Explain the uses of @BeforeEach, @BeforeAll, @AfterEach, @AfterAll annotations.
iii)Whis is purpose of assertAll?
iv)What is parameterized test? How to write parameterized test in Junit?
v)What are the advantages of parameterized test?
