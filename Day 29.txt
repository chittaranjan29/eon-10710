Agenda:
i)What is an algorithm?
ii)Role of algorithnm in Problem solving.
iii) Vital properties of an algorithm
iv) Advantages
v)Role of data structure
vi)Algorithnm optimization
vii)Sorting Algorithm(Bubble, Selection, Insertion Sort)


Algorithm: It is a sequence of logical steps carried out to solve a problem.


Problem: Addition of two numbers
Solution: 
i)declare a class with main method 
	  ii)declare variables (v1, v2, result)
          iii)take input from the user inside v1 and v2
          iv)perform addition of v1 and v2 and store the result in result vaariable
          v)print the value of result 
          
Problem: Check Prime Number
   
   i)Number of divisors between 1 to n is 2 or not.
   ii)If there is any divisor of the number between 2 to n/2.
   iii)If there is any divisor of the number between 2 to math.sqrt(n).If exist come out of the loop.
   iv)Print the number is prime or composithe.
   v)stop

Algorithm:
i) Read the value  of n.
ii)construct a loop and between 1 to sqrt(n) if any divisiors exits

A single problem can be solved in many ways, and each of this method is an algorithm. 

Problem: Print "Hello World" 100 times
i)Add 100 SOP statements and each of them would print "Hello World"
ii)Add a form loop staring from 1 and goes upto 100 and in the body need to print "Hello World+"

Vital properties of an algorithm:
i)Time Complexity(n log n, nlogn)
ii)Space Complexity

i)Finiteness: Ends within finite steps.
ii)Difiniteness: Steps are unambiguous and confusioln free.
iii)Inputs: Accept zero or more inputs.
iv)Output:Yields at least one output.
v) Effectivenfeess: Comprises feesible, time bound instruction  

Advantages:

i)Algoritm development involves identifying steps, decisions, and variables for program creation.
ii)Breaks the complex problem into managable subproblems for systematic resolution.
iii)Ensures consistency and reliability through uniform steps execution.
|iv)Enhances rational decision making by minimizing human biases.


Q:->Write an algorithm, flowchart and coding implementation of finding factorial of a number.

5!=1 * 2 *3 *4 *5 =120
4!= 1*2 * 3 * 4 = 24

Sorting: 
i)Selection Sort
