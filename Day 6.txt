Day : 6

Agenda:
i)this keyword
ii)static keyword
iii)String class and its methods


This:It is a refrence variable and referes to the current object/instance of the class.

i)this can refer current class instance variables.
ii)this can be used to call current class methods.
iii)this can be used to invoke current class constructor.
iv)It can be passed as argument in the method call.


static: The main purpose of static keyword is memory management. We can use static keyword for better memory utilization.
It belongs to the class rather than object. 


A variable which is declared with the static keyword is called static variable. It belong to the class rather than object.

A method which is declared with the static keyword is called static method. Inside a static method only static
variables can be accessed.

A block declared with the static keyword is called static block.

A static class is a class declared inside another class, is called a static nested class.




Uses:
i)To declare static variable.
ii)To declare static block.
iii)To declare static method.
iv)To declare nested class.


String: It is non-primitive data type. It is an object that stores a sequence of alphanumeric characters. 

String is a class from which objects are created.

Ways of declaring String:
i)Using string literal.  ex: String st="Year 2023!!";
ii)Using new keyword.    ex: String st=new String("Hello World!!");


i)Strings are immutable.(Non modifiable)

Interview Questions:
i)Whis is the use of this keyword?
ii)What is static keyword in Java?
iii)What is static method, variable, class and block? 
iv)Why String are immutable in Java?
v)What is string constant pool? How JVM manages String constants in the memory?
