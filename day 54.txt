Agenda:
i)Pass data from child to parent component
ii)Angular pipes
iii)Component life cycle hooks methods
iv)Angular Forms


Pass data from child to parent component
  i) Listen to child event 
     The child component exposes an EventEmitter property. This property adorned with the @Output() decorator.
     When the child component needs to communicate with the parent component it raises the event. The parent
     component listens to the event and responds to it.
	
  ii)Using local variable to access the child
  iii)Using @ViewChild to get the reference to the child component

Event Emitter:To raise an event, the component must declare an event emitter property. The event can be emitted
by calling the emit() method. 


Angular pipes:
Angular pipes are used to transform the data to display in the template. We can change the appearance of the
data before presenting it to the user. 

Example: currency, date, number, percent, decimal, slice etc.  

Syntax: 

  Expression | pipeOperator[:arguments]

  todate | date : 'short' 
Component life cycle hooks:
The Angular life cycle hooks are nothing but callback functions, which Angular invokes when a specific event
occurs during the component life cycle.

For example:

 i)NgOnInit when Angular initializes the component for the first time.
 ii)When a component's input property changes, Angular invokes NgOnChanges.
 iii) If the component is destroyed, Angular invokes ngOnDestroy.
