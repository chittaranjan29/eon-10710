**************************************
Collection Framework(Set, Queue, Map)
**************************************
Day 16: 11/1/24

Agenda:
i)Set interface:
It is a child interface of Collection interface.
It is located at java.util package.
It is an interface that implements the mathematical set.
Doesn't allow any duplicate value.
There are two interfaces that extends the set interface namely sortedSet and NavigableSet.
Implementation classes are TreeSet, HashSet, LinkedHashSet.

HashSet:
i)It implements the Set interface 
ii)Internally it uses hashtable for storage.(HashTable is a legacy class in Java)
iii)HashSet stores the element by using a mechanism called Hashing.
iv)HashSet contains only unique elements.
v)It does not allow duplicate but allows null value.
vi)It is non-synchronized.
vii)It doesn't maintain the insertion order. Elements are positioned on the basis of there hashcode.
viii)It is best suited for search operation.

LinkedHashSet:
i)It implements the set interface.
ii)LinkedList amd Hashtable data structure is used internally.
iii)Null values are allowed.
iv)Duplicates are not allow.
v)It maintains the insertion order. 
vi)Non-synchronized.

TreeSet:
i)It extends AbstractSet class and implements NavigableSet interface.
ii) Internally it uses a self balancing binary search tree.
iii) In TreeSet the data retrieval speed is quite fast.
iv)Null value not allowed.
v)It maintains ascending order.
vi)It is non-synchronized.

Queue:
i)Queue follows FIOF ordering for managing the elements.
ii)elements can be added or deleted from the (Enqueue,Dequeue).
iii)There are two pointer available in Queue namely front and rear,
iv)Elements are added at the front and and deleted from the rear end.
v)Implementation classes:PriorityQueue


PriorityQueue:
i)It processes the objects on the basis of priority value.
ii)It follow FIFO pattern.


Deque:
i)It is double ended queue.
ii)In double ended queue insertion and deletion of the elements can be dobe from either of the end.(rear and front)
iii)It can be used as a stack or queue.
iv)ArrayDeque implrmrnts the Deque interface.


ii)Implementation classes of Set(HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet)
iii)Queue interface
iv)Implementation class of Queue is PriorityQueue. 
v)Difference between iterator, listiterator and enumeration.
