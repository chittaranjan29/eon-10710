Day: 59, Date: 4/4/24


Agenda:
i)Hibernate bi-directional mapping
ii)Hibernate Object states(transient, persistent, detached, removed )
iii)Different types primary key generation strategies(AUTO, IDENTITY, TABLE, SEQUENCE)
 AUTO: It lets the persistence provider choose the generation strategy.
 IDENTITY: An auto-increment field is created in an optimized way. 
 TABLE: Internally it uses SEQUENCE in a pessimistic locking way which slows down your application. 
 SEQUENCE: Hibernate uses database sequence feature to generate the primary key. 
iv)Inheritance mapping
   a)MappedSuperclass Inheritance
   b)Single table Inheritance
   c)Joined table Inheritance
   d)Table per class Inheritance
