Two-way Databinding:
Angular provides a way to achieve two way data binding using [()]. Two way data binding is the combination of
property binding and event binding.

[] - Propery Binding
() - Event Binding

[()] - Property binding + Event Binding = Two way data binding(ngModel directive) 

ngModel :
The Angular uses the ngModel directive to achieve two way data binding on HTML Form elements, It binds to a form 
elements link input, select, textarea etc.

Internally it uses the ngmodel in property, binding to bind to the value property and ngModelChanges  which bind 
to the input event.

  In parent component
     i)Bind the child component property in the parent component when instantiating the child.
