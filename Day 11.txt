Day 11: 3/1/24


Agenda:
i)Final keyword:(restrict the user)
 a)Variable: It protect a variable from chaning the value.(Constant)
 b)class: It protect a class from getting inherited/extended.(Not Inheritable)
 c)method: It protect a method from getting overridden.(Can not override )

ii)What is a thread?
iii)What is a process?
iv)Difference between Thread and Process.
v)How to create thread in Java?
 a)By Extending Thread class
 b)By implementing Runnable interface
vi)Thread Life cycle.

Recap:
i)Abstraction: a) Abstract class 
               b)Interface(Java 8 - static & default method, Java 9 - private method)

Interface A(test()) --  a1, a2, b1, b2,....

Terminologies:
Program:It is a set of instructions.Instrctions are in a sequence to generate the output from the program.

Running program: It is a state of the prorgam. In this state all the instructions of the program are 
being executed by the CPU.Once all the instructions are excuted it will get terminted by the os.
 
CPU: Executes the program.

process:Process is an instance of the running program. A process represtents any program to control the state of the 
program.When the program is ended, the process associated with the program is killed by the OS.
Every process consume resources. Resources includes CPU, memory, disk and network. 


Resource:A resource is an entity representing System properties which is consumed by processes. 

thread:A thread is a small sub-process of the main process. Generally, a thread is resposible to carry out a small unit of task 
of the main process.

Chrome App: process (listening music, downloading movie, booking movie tickets)
            Sub-process(Thread)

Multitasking:Doing more than one task is called Multitasking.
 a)Process b)Thread

MultiProcessing:Processing multiple processes at the same time by the CPU(OS) is called multiprocessing.
MultiThreading: If multiple threads are running under a particulr process simultaneously it is called as Multithreading.


Differences between process and thread:

Thread Pool: It is a pool of threds waiting for arrival of new task. Once a task is arrived, OS will pick up a particular thread and will be assigned with the
new task. Once the task is completed it will be available for the new task. These are reusable threads. 

Thread Schedular: It is a component of Java that decides which thread to run and which thread to wait is called thread schedular
in Java. It follows some algorithm to order of the task execution. 

Algorithms:
 a)First Come First Serve(FCFS)  
 b)Time-slicing
 c)Preemptive-priority scheduling


p1 - 2ms


p2 - 2ms            [CPU]


p3 - 2ms
