Agenda:
i)Hibernate Inheritance Mapping
  a)MappedSuperclass
  b)Single Table
  c)Joined Table
  d)Table per class

ii)HQL (Hibernate Query Language)
iii)HCQL(Hibernate Criteria Query Language)


Mapping: 
 i)Unidirectional
 ii)Bidirectional


a)MappedSuperclass:Inheritance is implemented in the domain model only without reflecting it in the database schema. 
In this strategy, the parent classes can not be entities.

b)Single Table: The domain model class hierarchy is materilized into a single table that contains entities belonging to
different class types.

c)Joined Table: The base class and all the sub classes have their own database tables and fetching a subclass entity requirs to join the 
parent table.

d)Table per class: Each subclass has its own table containing both the subclass and the base class properties.
