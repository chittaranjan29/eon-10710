Agenda:
i)Unit testing
ii)Test Driven Development and Business Driven Development
iii)Junit Introduction
iv)Junit assert methods
iv)Junit annotations
v)Unit test cases



Purpose of testing:
i)Identifying bugs, defects and missing requirements in the project.
ii)Quality of the software can be maintained.

Banking App:
Account opening:
Unit testing:
i)Junit, testNg

Junit 5:
i)Junit Jupiter API(assert methods and annotations)
ii)Junit Jupiter Engine 
iii)Junit Vintage Engine 

i)Test class(A class in which we write all the test cases.)
ii)Test case(A test method where we write the logic of the test.)

src.main.java - business logic source code
src.test.java - test cases for testing business logic

bankapp.jar

assert methods:
i)assertTrue ii)assertNotNull iii)assertNull iv)assertSame v)assertFalse v)assertEquals vi)assertNotEquals
