OOPs Concept
*****************
Day 5:

Agenda:

i)Nested loop,switch(menu driven)
ii)Jump statements(break, continue)
iii)OOPs concept(Class, object, methods, constructors, this etc)

Class: It is a template or blueprint of the object.
Object: Object is an entity that has state and behaviour.


Employee - id, name, designation, department, salary etc - states
           signin, signout, applyLeaves, draw salary - actions/behaviours


OOP: 
class - instance variables - represents states of the object
        instance method    - represents the action/behaviours of the object 

Constructor:
It is a block of code which is called when the object/instance of the class is created.

i)Constructor name is always the same as the class name.
ii)Contructor may or may not have parameters/arguments.
iii)Constructor can not have any return type.
iv)Constructor can have access specifier like public, private or protected.
v)Every class must have atleast one constructor either declared explicitly or implicitly. 


Purpose:
i)It helps us to create and initialize objects/instances of the class. 

Types of constructor:
i) Default: A constructor which has empty arguments/parameters is called default constructor.
   purpose: Creates an empty object of the class.

ii)Parameterized: A constructor which accepts arguments or parameters is called parameterized constructor.
   purpose: Creates an empty object of the class and then initializes the properties of the class.

Constructor overloading:
Having more than one constructor is a class is called construtor overloading.

class Employee
{
  

}

for()
{
  condition
   continue;
   st1;
   st2;

}
