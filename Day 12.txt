Day 12: 4/1/24

Recap:
i)thread ii)Program iii)Process(system,app) iv)Running program v)Resources vi)Multitasking vii)Create a thread

Thread
Runable - run()
Agenda:
i)Life cycle of a thread:
 a)New
 b)Active -   Runnable - thread is ready to run, just waiting for the cpu, 
	      Running - the thread is in execution and cpu is execting the body of the thread
 c)Blocked or Waiting - Whenever a thread is inactive for a span of time, then it is in blocked state or in the waiting state
 f)timed-waiting - In this state the thread waits for a specified time duration. If the time is over then it is timeout.
 g)Terminated - A terminated thred goes to the dead state which means that the is no more in the system.


ii)Priority of a thread:
 It is a numeric value that is associated  with every thread. It denotes the importance of the thread.
 Priority value ranges between 1 to 10. 

 1 - Lowest Priority - LOW_PRIORITY
 5 - Normal/Default Priority - NORM_PRIORITY
 10 - Highest Priority - HIGH_PRIORITY

t1 - 1   - 2ms
t2 - 5  -  4ms
t3 - 10 -  6ms
getPriority()
setPriority()




iii)Thread pool:
A pool consists of a fixed number of reusable threads available to complete tasks of the clients.
Background: Server programs sucs as databases and web servers repeatedly executes requests from multiple clients and these
are oriemted aronud processing a large number of short tasks.


Numebr of request of the clients/end user = Number of threads  

50 thouseds requests = 50 thousand threads are created to handle to the client requests - Thread cycle overhead
server crashes/failed - due to the lack of resources - Resource thrashing.



iv)Thread Group:
ThreadGroup creates a group of threads. It is a very convinient way to manage groups of threads as a unit. 
This is particularly very important in a situation in which you want to suspend or resume a number of related threads.
   

v)Deamon thread: It is a special type of thread which has the lowest priority among all the other threads.
The life span of a deamon thread dependes on the mercy of the user thareds. As long as user threads are running, deamon thread will also
be running in the system. Once user threads are completed JVM will terminate the deamon thread.
The main purpose of a deamon thread is to provide services linke garbage collection, resource initialisation and close etc.
